Using the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution 
of 28×28 pixels, we designed and implemented a relatively simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to 
extract meaningful features and classify the digits. The goal was to analyze various aspects of the CNN’s 
architecture, training performance, feature extraction capabilities, and classification accuracy. For our 
implementation, we used the TensorFlow library, leveraging its built-in functionalities for defining, 
training, and evaluating deep learning models. The CNN consists of a structured sequence of layers 
designed to progressively transform the input images into a highly informative feature representation.
